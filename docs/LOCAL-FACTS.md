# Local facts: does this work in Lagos today?

Every claim the app makes about Lagos, with where it comes from and when it was checked.
The rule: a local claim gets a source (a URL and the date it was checked) or a live test from
a development machine in Lagos. If it cannot be checked, it is left out or labelled plainly.

This file exists because the first build shipped a "Book Uber" button weeks after Uber left
Nigeria (2 Sep 2026). The research behind that button checked how Uber's links work, and
never asked whether Uber works in Lagos. Each section below answers that second question.

## Social hours

The sloth never plans a hangout at a time people would not go. These are assumptions, not
measurements, and they live in one place (`SOCIAL_HOURS` in `src/core/weather.mjs`):

| Kind of plan | Hours (Lagos time) | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Weekend outdoor | 11:00 to 18:30 | Late enough to be up and out; done before dark. In 2025 sunset in Lagos ran from 18:25 (8 Nov) to 19:06 (11 Jul): Open-Meteo archive, `archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive?latitude=6.45&longitude=3.40&daily=sunset&timezone=Africa/Lagos` for 2025, checked 21 Oct 2026. Late October and November dusk is close to 18:30, so the cut-off is tight on purpose. |
| Weekend covered or indoor | 11:00 to 21:00 | The same start, and a roof means dark does not matter. |
| Weekday evening, covered or indoor | 17:30 to 21:00 | After work. |
| Weekday outdoor | 17:30 to 18:30 | Only the light part of a weekday evening. |

When rain blocks every acceptable window, the sloth does one of these, in order:

1. Moves the plan to a dry stretch of at least two hours inside the same day's social hours.
2. Moves it to the next day, if that day is the same kind (Saturday to Sunday, never Sunday
   to Monday).
3. Offers a place with a roof, if a source says the place is covered (no curated spot has
   that yet, so in practice this step finds nothing).
4. Skips the slot and says why, from the forecast numbers: "Rain all afternoon on Saturday
   (up to 95% between 11 am and 6:30 pm), and Sunday looks no better. The sloth is skipping
   this one." No calendar entry is made for a skipped ritual, and no Gemma call is spent.

Before this change, the forecast of 21 Oct 2026 (storms from midday on Saturday 24 Oct, a
drier morning) moved the crew's Saturday afternoon to 8 to 10 am. Nobody meets friends in a
Lagos park at 8 am on a Saturday. With the same forecast the sloth now skips the slot.

Tested in `test/weather.test.mjs` and `test/service.test.mjs`.
